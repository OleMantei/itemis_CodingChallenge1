### ðŸš€ Setup

Youâ€™ll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your local development machine.\
Please install the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

The frontend is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/).\
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used as a frontend build tool.\
The project implements [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) a unit-test framework.

**To run the project, use the following commands:**\
`yarn install` (installs all dependencies)\
`yarn run dev` (starts development server)

**Check if all tests pass:**\
`yarn test`

### ðŸ—‚ File Structure
My solution to the challenge is in the file `./src/js/receipt.js`.\
All functions are tested by vitest. The tests that are run can be found in the file `./src/js/receipt.test.js`.

### ðŸ’ª Challenge

**Problem 1: SALES TAXES**

Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax
applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions. When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items,
and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets...
